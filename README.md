# Stimulus TypeScript Starter

A preconfigured blank slate for exploring [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus) with TypeScript. Implements the basic 'Hello Stimulus' example from [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/hello-stimulus).

_Please note that this example does not currently work, due to an incompatibility between Stimulus, TypeScript and Babel 7. See [this issue](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus/issues/221) for more details._

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus-starter.git
$ cd stimulus-starter
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Building

```

```
